# **Recap**

## This workshop covered:
- What R Markdown is and why itâ€™s useful
- How to create and compile an R Markdown file in RStudio
- Basic structure of an R Markdown file

Now you are equipped to work with R Markdown and leverage its useful features to improve efficiency and reproducibility.

## Further Learning:
Practice and use additional resources to build your skill to the next level.
- If you are new to Markdown, you may find it helpful to go through the [Markdown Tutorial](https://commonmark.org/help/tutorial/) or use [stackedit](https://stackedit.io/).
- I don't recommend setting aside time to learn the code chunk options and YAML arguments; searching for answers when in need is fine.

You can also attend other workshops or book a consultation with the research commons.
